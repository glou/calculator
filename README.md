# calculator

This is an implementation of a calculator (simple, not a scientific one), inside The Odin Project curriculum.
Done through HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Started in September, 8, 2021.

- Update 9/11: the repository already has the structure files, some of the basic functions inside the script. No visual elements yet.

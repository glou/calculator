# calculator

This is an implementation of a calculator (simple, not a scientific one), inside The Odin Project curriculum.
Done through HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Started in September, 8, 2021.

- Update 9/17: I've finished the project. Looking at first update's date (and only update; I need to improve on this, not only on commits),
  I thought I'd have taken longer than I actually did to do the calculator.
  
  IMPORTANT: this project is the most complex so far, and I've felt strong needs of learning test suites. I consider the calculator ready
  for use, I tested it a considerable amount, but I don't know how much it's, or it is not, bug free.

- Update 9/11: the repository already has the structure files, some of the basic functions inside the script. No visual elements yet.
